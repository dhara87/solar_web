### **DIY Solar Installation quality and cost savings explained** 

**Quality Aspect:**

Australian solar market is rapidly growing; with the increased opportunities thousands of small scale
solar companies enter the market every year. However, most of them start struggling within first 3 years
of their operation when they encounter increased number of customer complaints of product
malfunctioning which is often a problem when cheap products are installed by a cheap solar installer to
cut down the labor cost, these installers often accompany young roofers who are inexperienced and
have incomplete or zero knowledge of installing rooftop solar. Thus, don’t be surprised if your roof
starts leaking within couple of years after solar installation. Incorrect installation may save some upfront
cost for a solar company; however, they turn out to be nightmare when manufacturers reject product
warranty due to incorrect solar installation.

These challenges often make it impossible for the solar companies to survive and they go under
liquidation within first 5 years leaving thousands of customers behind with cheap and unwarranted
products lying on their roof and even leaking roof in worst case scenarios.

Over 700 solar companies have vanished from Australian solar market alone in the past 8 years.

Scary isn’t it?

DIY solar is not only about saving thousands of dollars but also ensuring quality solar installation by
taking power on your own hand.

Only DIY solar gives you an opportunity to select your choice of qualified and experienced solar installer,
now you have a chance to install your solar risk free by selecting a well qualified and experienced
installer of your choice and not relying on cost saving solar companies who often selects a cheap
installer to maximize their profit. 

**Cost Saving Aspect:**

You not only have the power of select the products, warehouses and installers of your choice but also
have the power to save thousands of $$$$ from your pocket. Did you know a quality solar system of 6.6
kW size will cost you more than eight thousand dollars when you choose to get it done from a
professional solar company? Whereas you can get the same solar system under three thousand dollars
when you choose to do it yourself. Isn’t it a big deal? Saving more than five thousand of dollars and also
ensuring quality solar installation.

Professional solar companies often charges high commissions not only on products but also on solar
installation, freight and to keep up with their logistic costs. The list doesn’t end here; it goes on for years
when you ask for support and services. This trap is a never ending story.
