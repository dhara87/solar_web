### **The Best Global Solar Panel Manufacturers**

<!--EndFragment-->

<!--StartFragment-->

The global warming and climate crisis stimulate the nations to shift to cleaner energy sources. Solar energy is the major source of sustainable power. It can be harnessed through either solar-thermal or solar PV technologies. The former utilized the heat of solar energy, while the latter transforms the light from the sun into electric power directly.

The on-grid solar photovoltaic industry has been growing extremely fast during the recent years. As of 2017, the amount of solar electricity generated was reported to grow by more than 30% and to reach 460 terawatt-hours, which constituted nearly 2 percent of the global power production. By the turn of 2021-2022, the world’s solar PV electricity production is forecasted to exceed 1,120 terawatt-hours.

Today, the leader of solar power generation and usage is China, in some regions of which solar electricity has become cheaper compared to grid power. 

The technologies are developing; PV modules are becoming more powerful, reliable, efficient and eco-friendly. A few hundred companies worldwide are engaged in manufacturing of photovoltaic cells, modules and other solar products. For your convenience, we have compiled a listing of the top solar panel manufacturers recognized globally.

The corporation started manufacturing photovoltaic panels more than three decades ago and is currently the top solar innovator. It makes highly efficient crystalline PV cells and panels for home and business application. The company headquartered in Californian San Jose is the main solar power producer in USA. During 2019, SP’s solar power generation exceeded 18 TWh. SP studies particular needs and preferences of its customers and creates products suitable for different budgets and demands. Among its clients are US government and military. The product range includes industry-first 400Wp-power A-Series Home Solar Panels, which are 22.3-percent efficient. The older models are extremely powerful and efficient as well (with no less than 340 watts-peak output and 20-percent conversion rate). The only exception is its oldest 18-percent efficient P-Series with the power ranging 380-400Wp.

The Changzhou-located firm is also among the biggest panel producers around the world. It was established more than 20 years ago. The product selection offered is extremely wide (including wafer, ingot, PV cell and module) and is meant for industrial, business, and domestic use. The solutions are based on new-generation techs like bi-facial, half-cut cell, dual-glass, passivated emitter and rear contact, as well as standard p type single-crystal and polycrystalline silicon PV cells. The Chinese company is India’s main solar product supplier today. TS’s solar solutions allow remote monitoring of panel operation through advanced cloud infrastructures. One of its best models is 18.8-percent efficient DUOMAX M PLUS. The modules consist of 60 PV cells and produce between 280 and 310 watts-peak of power.

Japan used to be the solar energy market leader and the only US’s competitor before giving way to China. All Asia-based colossi are either extremely specialized or huge-sized and widely scoped (which concerns Japan’s companies as well). We all know Panasonic as a maker of such electronic devices as smartphones, cameras or air-conditioners, but it is also a solar panel producer. Its PV modules are characterized by superb reliability. One of its best series is 330N HIT. The panel comprises 96 solar cells and is 19.7-percent efficient. But what puts Panasonic’s panels apart from its rivals is the extremely low temp coefficient – only -0.258%/°C (compared to standard -0.4%/°C). This is an essential factor because with every degree above 25°C the solar module’s performance decreases. Unlike any other solar products, Panasonic’s devices perform excellently even in the hottest weather.
