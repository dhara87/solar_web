GoodWe is a leading, strategically-thinking enterprise which focuses on research and manufacturing of PV inverters and energy storage solutions. With 12 GW installed in more than 100 countries, GoodWe solar inverters have been largely used in residential, commercial rooftops, industrial and utility scale systems, ranging from 0.7 to 80kW.

GoodWe's philosophy is to always create win-win partnerships with customers by identifying and integrating the most advanced components and techniques available while offering an unparalleled after-sales service. TÃœV Rheinland, the great provider of technical services worldwide, awarded GoodWe as the winner of "All Quality Matters Award" for 4 consecutive years, for both its outstanding on-grid and storage solutions.

Thanks to the reliable operation and excellent performance of GoodWe inverters, the GoodWe brand image has been well recognized by customers and business partners worldwide. In 2019, GoodWe has been awarded the 2019 Top Brand PV seal for the Australian Market, as announced by independent market research specialist EuPD Research. The survey analyzes brand perception, service & support, preferred customer choice and distribution in global markets in order to identify the inverter brand which distinguishes itself from the rest in the perception of their customers.
